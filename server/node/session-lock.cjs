// Cross-device single-writer session lock.
//
// The app's data model allows exactly one writing client (the in-memory DB is
// synced coarsely — concurrent writers would silently clobber each other).
// This module decides WHICH session holds that write lock, replacing the old
// rule of "the last page load steals it", which produced spurious kicks: a
// phone tab resurrected by the OS (= a page load) would silently take the lock
// from a PC mid-session, and merely glancing at a second device would kick the
// one actually being used.
//
// Rules:
//  - register(id): called at page load. Records the session's boot time but
//    does NOT steal an active lock — opening the app must never kick the
//    device being used. Adopts the lock only when nobody holds it.
//  - checkWrite(id, userActive): called on every data write. The active
//    session passes and refreshes its lastWriteAt. A non-active session takes
//    over IFF BOTH hold:
//      · fresh — it booted AFTER the active session's last accepted write, so
//        its boot loaded the state including that write (cannot clobber), AND
//      · userActive — the client reports a recent user gesture. The app also
//        writes WITHOUT the user doing anything (boot housekeeping, the
//        flush-on-hide keepalive), and an automatic write must never move the
//        lock: a phone tab going to background fires a flush, and that used
//        to steal the lock from the PC actually in use.
//    Fresh but NOT user-active → the write passes WITHOUT taking over (it is
//    fresh, so applying it cannot clobber; rejecting it instead would set off
//    reload loops on boot-time auto-saves). lastWriteAt is not bumped — the
//    lock holder did not write.
//    Stale → rejected (423 → the client reloads; after the reload its boot is
//    recent, so its next user action takes over cleanly).
//
// Serial device switching (the single-user pattern) therefore never shows a
// block: you stop writing on A, open B (booted after A's last write), and B's
// first action takes the lock. A only ever sees a 423 if it writes again
// afterwards — the one genuinely necessary kick.
//
// State is in-memory: a server restart clears it and the first write adopts.
